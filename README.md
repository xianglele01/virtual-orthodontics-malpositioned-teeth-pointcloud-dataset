## Dataset Description
This dataset is constructed for the research study entitled *Study on Automatic Alignment of Malpositioned Teeth in Virtual Orthodontic Treatment Based on an Improved PointNet Algorithm*. It consists of standardized 3D point cloud data of malpositioned teeth, which is dedicated to developing and verifying deep learning-based automatic alignment algorithms for virtual orthodontic treatment.

### Data Details
1. Data modality: 3D tooth point cloud
2. Research scenario: Virtual orthodontic malpositioned tooth alignment
3. Annotation: Standardized spatial coordinate labels for tooth alignment evaluation

### Usage Purpose
The dataset is used to train, validate and test the improved PointNet model for automatic spatial positioning and alignment of malpositioned teeth, supporting algorithm performance comparison and clinical orthodontic simulation verification.

### Access Instruction
The complete point cloud dataset is publicly accessible from this repository. All data files are stored in the `data/` directory and can be downloaded directly for academic research only.
